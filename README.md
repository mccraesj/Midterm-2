# Midterm-2

## Part 1

From my analysis of the global milk Consumption and Production, there were 2 glaring conclusions that I had come to discover. First was the outrageously igh production of milk compared to the consumption of it. There are several factors more of milk being produced than milk being consumed. Secondly, the production of milk has been stedily growing since the mid 1900s and does not seem to be largely impacted by the consumption of milk. The second conclusion likely means there are other sources that are utilizing overproduced milk such as dairy products, but based off the data collected it is worth pointing out.

## Part 2

evermore and folklore seem to be very similar albums given the statistics that I have collected. Based on my findings their distrobution of happy/sad words seem to be very similar with evermore having a lot more perminent of words such as dead, leave, and lost. This contrasts to folklore's top words that seem to be more future focused and hopeful with top words being marvelous, time, and remember. Both albums had love as a top word. When doing a deeper dive into the sentiments, we find that again, theres a pretty even distrobution of happy and sad words overall and between the two songs. Lastly, when analysing the Dancability and tempo of the songs, the songs with a higher precent of positive words seemed to have overall had a higher dancibility which is in line with what we'd expect, but the tempo of the song did not seem to be impacted by the word sentiment of the song.
